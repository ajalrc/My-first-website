        <h1>About the web maker.</h1>
        <p>My name is Ajal RC. I am an international student in Drake University, Des Moine Iowa. 
           Interestingly, I did not encounter computers until high school as my school didn’t have enough funds to purchase one.
            When I first studied computer science, it engaged my mind and soul. I enjoy taking courses in computer science and working on various projects.
            I taught myself my first programming language, Python, from websites such as EDX. I didn’t have enough money to buy the certified course so, I watched the content videos and completed online projects.
            Still, I keep watching many online computer courses in Udemy and teach myself something new every day. Recently, I completed a course on “Algorithm and data structures” 
            from Princeton in Coursera as we all know “A regular PC with a good algorithm is as fast as a supercomputer with a bad algorithm.” And right now, I am teaching myself “The
            Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking” from Google just to know how the network works.  
            
            I am constantly exploring various sectors in computer science and Web development has been my top priority right now.
            And my final words "CODE IS GOD."
