        <h1>About the web maker.</h1>
        <p>My name is Ajal RC. I am an international student in Drake University, Des Moine Iowa. 
            I am here on Visa until the completion of my undergraduate study. I didn't study computer science until I came to The United States. I didn't think that computers
            were for me, but still I was interested in computers and its immense potential and so, I decided to give it a try. I taught myself my first programming language Python from EDX and I 
            absolutely loved it. That jumped started my love for computer and made me take computer science courses in my University.The person who had not see computer back in Nepal now has a major in Computer Science.
            How more surprising can that be. Now, I am exploring different fields of computer science and learning something new everyday from Cloud Computing to Algorithms and Data Structures. Hope I find the field that I would like to have my carreer pretty soon.
            And my final words "CODE IS GOD."
